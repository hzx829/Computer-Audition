I put all the functions here, but main function Pop_Onset_Beats.m.
I use Pop.wav as my input audio singal.
You can write your own main function(read audio files and set parameters) and use it to process audio files.
You need Communications System Toolbox to run the synth_onset.m function,since I use function wgn(),which is in that toolbox.
